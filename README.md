This is my first team preject using React, Redux, Express and Firebase. 
Project's main idea was to convert xml files with archives to simple json file and display it in browser.
The main functionality is to provide the user with an ability of making changes to this json and save it back to archives and xml.
User interfase has been made with React and Redux and performed according to 'user friendly reles'. 
Project include user authorization as one of the point was to make it pretected from strangers as it deals with sencitive information.
